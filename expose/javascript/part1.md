1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. The code returns an error becuase the variable "result" is only defined in the if block statement not outside of it becuase it is declared with "let".
5. The code returns an error becuase you cannot reassign "result" to be num1 + num2 becuase it is a constant, its value will remain the same as the first time it is assigned and it had already been assigned to 0.
6. Same as question 5 the code returns an error because "result" cannot be reassigned.
